# NEU-NoWaitlistBot

* Tired of no waitlist available in Northeastern for subjects you want? 
* Are you a programming geek?

Well here is a script for you...

Just put in details of course you wanna scan with this bot. Put in a few more details and you are good to go. 

1. It will scan the targeted page programtically to see if there is any available seat.
1. Once bot finds a seat it will automatically login and enroll you into that course. Hurray!

## How to use:

1. Install [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) plugin into google chrome. 
1. Import script into tampermonkey "NEU Course Registration Bot.user.js".
1. Open tampermonkey dashboard and edit this script. Add customization in config section.
1. Open one chrom tab to a course page eg like [this](https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=201830&subj_in=CS&crse_in=7290&schd_in=LEC). Keep that open for script to run on it.

## FAQ:

1. Why do you need NEU username and password?
Ans: If you need functionality of auto enrollment script needs a NEU session to enroll you. NEU sessions timeout frequently and you have no gurantee if you will have active session when you find a seat.

**It is an open source script feel free to audit it!**
